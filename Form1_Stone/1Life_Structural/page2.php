    <p>4. Structural Aspects</p>

    <p>a. The roof is constructed such that it is not integral within itself (i.e., it does not act as a single unit and breaks open during earthquake shaking) and is not anchored into the walls</p>

    <input type="radio" name="4c" value='Y'/>Yes
    <input type="radio" name="4c" value='N'/>No
    <br/><br/>

    <p>5. Construction Details</p>

    <p>a. The walls of the house are made with mud mortar and are exposed to the vagaries of the outside weather (especially rain water beating)</p>
