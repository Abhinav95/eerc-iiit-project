##For forms

Create separate file for each form, with the name [form-x].php

Here is an example format for the form file: 

```
<form action="form-x-backend.php">

<input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your full name" />

.
.
.

</form>
```

Note: Do not put `<html>` or other header tags in the form files. Just the form element. 

All form files should be created in root directory (with the js and css folders)
