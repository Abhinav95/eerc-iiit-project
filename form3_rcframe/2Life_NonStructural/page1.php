<form action="page1-backend.php">

<p>1. Acceleration or Displacement Hazards</p>
<p>a. Heavy unanchored projections, overhangs, decoratives, and
elevational features not strapped to the frame grid (i.e., beams and
columns) are present outside the building.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="N"> No


<p>b. Heavy & tall slender items are unanchored inside the building.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="N"> No


<p>c. False ceilings are hung from slab above, are not anchored to the
frame grid of the building.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1c" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1c" value="N"> No


<p>d.Heavy objects on/in lofts/shelves inside the house, which are likely to
topple, are not anchored to frame grid (i.e., beams and columns) of
the building.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1d" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1d" value="N"> No


<p>e. Large size window, door or other panels made of plain glass are fit
snugly between the frame panels (i.e., beams and columns).</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1e" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1e" value="N"> No


<p>f. The building has exposed wood used in the construction (either as
wall panels, roofs, lofts, or floors) or exposed cloth in finishing, at
points close to locations of potential stove fire, electric sparks or gas
leakage fire that can result in a fire in the house during an
earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1f" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1f" value="N"> No

<p>g. The building has electricity supply wires held rigidly between the
building and the street pole with no slack, that can result in short
circuiting and fire during an earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1g" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1g" value="N"> No

<p>h. The gas cylinders are not strapped to the frame grid (i.e., beams and
columns) of the building, that can result in toppling of the cylinders,
which in turn can lead to gas leakage and thereby fire during an
earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1h" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1h" value="N"> No
