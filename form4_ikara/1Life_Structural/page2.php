    <p>2. Soil and Foundation Conditions</p>
    <p>a. The soil underneath the house is liquefiable.</p>
    <input type="radio" name="_2a" value="Y"> Yes
    <input type="radio" name="_2a" value="N"> No


    <p>b. The soil in the area adjoining the site is liquefiable and can flow
        laterally to move the soil from underneath the house.</p>
        <input type="radio" name="_2b" value="Y" > Yes
        <input type="radio" name="_2b" value="N"> No
        
        <p>c. The soil underneath the house is weak,loose bearing capacity under lateral shaking, and the posts pierce into the ground consequently.</p>
        <input type="radio" name="_2c" value="Y" > Yes
        <input type="radio" name="_2c" value="N"> No

        <p>d. The soil in the area is of alluvial nature,which is susceptible to amplification of ground motion close to the natural frequency of the variation of the built house.</p>
        <input type="radio" name="_2d" value="Y" > Yes
        <input type="radio" name="_2d" value="N"> No

        <p>3. Architectural Features</p>
        <p>a. The house is touching or located too close to the adjacent seemingly unsafe house/construction.</p>
        <input type="radio" name="_3a" value="Y" > Yes
        <input type="radio" name="_3a" value="N"> No


        <p>b. The house is built on two or more stilts so as to have access from the road.</p>
