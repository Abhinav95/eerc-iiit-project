<p>4. Structural Aspects</p>
<p>a. The roof is constructed such that it is not integral within itself(i.e., it does not act as a single unit and breaks open during earthquake shaking) and is not anchored into the walls.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4a" value="N"> No


<p>b. The doubly-pitched roof does not have an eve's band OR formal truss is absent.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4b" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4b" value="N"> No


<p>c. The posts,rafters and purlins are tied with coir ropes that are deteriorated</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4c" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4c" value="N"> No

<p>d. The house is built on two or more stilts so as to have access from the road</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4d" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4d" value="N"> No

<p>e. The house has a heavy mass placed unsymmetrical to stiffness elements in the house, which induces torsion during earthquake shaking.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4e" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4e" value="N"> No

<p>5. Construction Details</p>
<p>a. The wood posts,rafters and purlins are attached by termites,fungi or other pests,and their load carrying capacity is reduced to the extent of being unable to resist effects of earthquake shaking.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_5a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_5a" value="N"> No

<p>b. The wood has deteriorated due to passage of time.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_5b" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_5b" value="N"> No
