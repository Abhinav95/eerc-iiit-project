<!-- Confined Masonry House -->
<!-- Life-threatening Factors related to the STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS -->

<form action="page1-backend.php">
<!-- 1 -->
<p>1. Site Conditions</p>

<p>a. House is built on reclaimed ground that was originally a river bed or lake bed, but is susceptible to inundation </p>
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="N"> No

<p>b. House is built on reclaimed ground that was originally a river bed, lake bed or solid-waster refilled land, but is susceptible amplification of ground motion close to the fundamental natural frequency of the CM house </p>
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="N"> No

<!-- 2 -->
<p>2. Soil Conditions</p>

<p>a. The soil underneath the house is liquefiable.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_2a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_2a" value="N"> No

<p>b. The soil in the area adjoining the site is liquefiable and can flow laterally to move the soil from underneath the house.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_2b" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_2b" value="N"> No

<p>c. Soil underneath the house is weak, loose bearing capacity under lateral shaking, and the plinth walls pierce into the ground consequently or the building tilts.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_2c" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_2c" value="N"> No

<!-- 3 -->
<p>3. Architectural Features</p>

<p>a. House is touching or located too clo se to the adjacent seemingly unsafe house/construction </p>
<input type="radio" name="_3a" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_3a" value="N"> No

<!-- 4 -->
<p>4. Material Details</p>

<p>a. Steel reinforcement bars are corroded in horizontal reinforcement bands and vertical reinforcement elements of masonry walls, and the
integrity of walls is jeopardized to the extent of being unable to resist effects of earthquake shaking.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4a" value="N"> No

<!-- 5 -->
<p>5. Structural Aspects</p>

<p>a. Roof is unanchored into the walls and vertical reinforcing elements.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_5a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_5a" value="N"> No

<p>b. Sill and Lintel Bands are not continuous at wall junctions, because longitudinal reinforcement bars in bands do not overlap by the required amount.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_5b" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_5b" value="N"> No
