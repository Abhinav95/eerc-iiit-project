<form action="page1-backend.php">

<p>1. Siting Issues</p>
<p>a. The house is built on hill slopes or elevated mounds that can slide.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="N"> No

<p>b. The house is built on river terraces that can slide/creep.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="N"> No

<p>c. The house is built on hill slopes /adjacent to hill slopes (even though on
flat ground), but vulnerable to falling debris from the hill top.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1c" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1c" value="N"> No


<p>2. Soil and Foundation Conditions</p>
<p>a. The soil underneath the building is liquefiable.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_2a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_2a" value="N"> No


<p>b. The soil in the area adjoining the site is liquefiable and can flow
laterally to move the soil from underneath the building.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_2b" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_2b" value="N"> No


<p>3. Architectural Features</p>
<p>a. The outer dimensions of the house at plinth level are less than those at
the top in either of the two horizontal plan directions.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_3a" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_3a" value="N"> No


<p>b. The house has large una nchored projections and overhangs.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_3b" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_3b" value="N"> No


<p>c. The door and window openings in walls are at the corners.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_3c" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_3c" value="N"> No


<p>d. The building is almost touching or located close to an adjacent
seemingly unsafe building/construction, whose collapse/pounding can
damage it.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_3d" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_3d" value="N"> No

<p>4. Structural Aspects</p>
<p>a. The roof is constructed such that it is not integral within itself (i.e., it does not act as a single unit and breaks open during earthquake shaking) and is not anchored into the walls.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4a" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4a" value="N"> No


<p>b. The walls are thick and made in two wythes.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4b" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4b" value="N"> No


<p>c. The walls are not integrated into each other at the corners.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4c" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4c" value="N"> No


<p>d. The staircases are not anchored into the walls of the house.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_4d" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_4d" value="N"> No


<p>5. Construction Details</p>
<p>a. The walls are made with mud mortar and are exposed to the vagaries of the outside weather (especially rain water beating).</p>
<input type="radio" name="_5a" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_5a" value="N"> No


<p>b. The walls are made with no mortar.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_5b" value="Y" > Yes
<input type="radio" name="_5b" value="N"> No
