<p>a. Large objects on the roof are unanchored.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="N"> No


<p>b. Shelves inside the house are unanchored.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="N"> No


<p>c. Lofts inside the house are unanchored.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1c" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1c" value="N"> No


<p>d. Objects on/in the lofts/shelves inside the house are unanchored.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1d" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1d" value="N"> No


<p>e. The house ha s exposed wood used in the construction of the house (either as wall panels, roofs, lofts, or floors), exposed cloth in finishing of the house, or thatch or husk, at points close to locations of potential stove fire, electricity sparks or gas leakage fire that can result in a fire in the house during an earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1e" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1e" value="N"> No


<p>f. The house has electricity wires held rigidly between the house and the street pole with no slack, that can result in short circuiting and fire during an earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1f" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1f" value="N"> No


<p>g. Gas cylinders are not strapped to the wall, that can result in toppling of the cylinders, which in turn can lead to gas leakage and thereby fire during an earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1g" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1g" value="N"> No

<p>2. Lifelines</p>

<p>a. Electricity wires are held rigidly between the house and the street pole with no slack, that can result in short circuiting and electrocution during an earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_2a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_2a" value="N"> No


<p>b. The gas cylinders are not strapped to the wall, that can result in toppling of the cylinders, which in turn can lead to gas leakage and
thereby asphyxiation of persons during an earthquake.</p>
